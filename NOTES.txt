Upon opening the page, the JS will hit the database and look for the first game object with only three keys

If it finds a match, then it will append a new player object into the game object

otherwise it will create a new game object, and append a new player object into the game object

depending on whether the player is p1/2:
- their name is written into the p1/2_name field
- when they make a move for the round, it is written to the p1/2_move field

need a listener for the p1_move and p2_move fields, if both have values, then:

execute the logic to see whether the player's move beats the opponent's move
if you lost, then display message for lost round

^^ but will this listener actually work, since it would keep firing until the moves were cleared from the database? 
^^ Or can it trigger only once when the fields are updated?
